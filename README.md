# Speech_Analysis_Buhari
Here, I use rvest to scrap The President's speeches found in https://statehouse.gov.ng/. (Help needed make this automated - see speech scraping file).
A corpus of 53 speeches are then created and analysed (exploratory and clustering), focusing on 'state' mentioned and 3 key policies ('economic', 'security' and 'corruption'). 

I plan to update the corpus as more speeches are made - see changes to tune with the upcoming elecetion (Febryary, 2019)
